## Automated Machine Learning 

The `mljar-supervised` is an Automated Machine Learning Python package that works with tabular data. It is designed to save time for a data scientist. It abstracts the common way to preprocess the data, construct the machine learning models, and perform hyper-parameters tuning to find the best model. 

It is no black-box as you can see exactly how the ML pipeline is constructed (with a detailed Markdown report for each ML model).

It has built-in three modes of work:
 - `Explain` mode, which is ideal for explaining and understanding the data, with many data explanations, like decision trees visualization, linear models coefficients display, permutation importances and SHAP explanations of data,
 - `Perform` for building ML pipelines to use in production,
 - `Compete` mode that trains highly-tuned ML models with ensembling and stacking, with a purpose to use in ML competitions.

Of course, you can further customize the details of each mode to meet requirements.

It integrates many popular frameworks:

 - pandas
 - scikit-learn
 - xgboost
 - lightGBM
 - CatBoost
 - Tensorflow
 - Keras


## What's good in it?

- `mljar-supervised` creates markdown reports from AutoML training. The example of AutoML leaderboard summary:

The example for `Decision Tree` summary:

The example for `LightGBM` summary:

- This package is computing `Baseline` for your data. So you will know if you need Machine Learning or not! You will know how good are your ML models comparing to the `Baseline`. The `Baseline` is computed based on prior class distribution for classification, and simple mean for regression.
- This package is training simple `Decision Trees` with `max_depth <= 5`, so you can easily visualize them with amazing [dtreeviz](https://github.com/parrt/dtreeviz) to better understand your data.
- The `mljar-supervised` is using simple linear regression and include its coefficients in the summary report, so you can check which features are used the most in the linear model.
- It is using a vast set of algorithms: `Random Forest`, `Extra Trees`, `LightGBM`, `Xgboost`, `CatBoost` (`Neural Networks` will be added soon).
- It can do features preprocessing, like: missing values imputation and converting categoricals. What is more, it can also handle target values preprocessing (You won't believe how often it is needed!). For example, converting categorical target into numeric.
- It can tune hyper-parameters with `not-so-random-search` algorithm (random-search over defined set of values) and hill climbing to fine-tune final models.
- It can compute Ensemble based on greedy algorithm from [Caruana paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~alexn/papers/shotgun.icml04.revised.rev2.pdf).
- It cares about explainability of models: for every algorithm, the feature importance is computed based on permutation. Additionally, for every algorithm the SHAP explanations are computed: feature importance, dependence plots, and decision plots (explanations can be switched off with `explain_level` parameter).

## Quick example

There is a simple interface available with `fit` and `predict` methods.

```python
import pandas as pd
from supervised.automl import AutoML

df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pplonski/datasets-for-start/master/adult/data.csv", skipinitialspace=True)

X = df[df.columns[:-1]]
y = df["income"]

automl = AutoML(results_path="directory_with_reports")
automl.fit(X, y)

predictions = automl.predict(X)
```

For details please check [AutoML API Docs](docs/api.md).
